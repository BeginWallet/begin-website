Cardano's DeFi ecosystem continues to grow, and Liqwid stands at the forefront when it comes to decentralized lending. If you're looking to earn yield on your ADA, lending through Liqwid is one of the most powerful strategies — and with Begin Wallet, it's now easier than ever.

## 💼 What Is Liqwid?

Liqwid is a decentralized lending protocol built on Cardano that allows users to lend and borrow assets without intermediaries. You can earn interest by lending your ADA or stablecoins, or borrow assets using your crypto as collateral.

## 🚀 Why Lend With Begin Wallet?

Begin Wallet brings Liqwid lending to your fingertips with a simple, secure, and intuitive experience. Through the **Invest** tab in the app, you can lend ADA or stablecoins and start earning interest right away.

### Key Features:
- ✅ Self-custody: your assets stay in your control.
- ✅ High-yield options with rates up to 20% APY.
- ✅ Direct access to Liqwid from your wallet — no need to visit external dApps.
- ✅ Real-time portfolio tracking.

## 🔐 How It Works

1. Open the **Invest** tab in Begin Wallet.
2. Tap "Lend & Earn".
2. Choose stablecoins like USDM, USDA, USDC, USDT, iUSD or DJED.
3. Tap “Deposit” and confirm the transaction.
4. Watch your interest accrue over time — it's that simple.

You’ll also be able to withdraw anytime, and your yield is automatically reinvested.

## 💡 Pro Tip: Optimize Your Yield

To maximize returns, you can:
- Monitor APY changes in real-time via Begin.
- Diversify between ADA and stablecoins.
- Reinvest your earnings periodically.

## 📈 What's Coming Next?

Liqwid continues to evolve, and so does Begin. Future updates will include:
- Lending pools with variable and fixed rates.
- Cross-chain lending support.
- Deeper integration of borrowing and leveraging strategies.
