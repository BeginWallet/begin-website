## Open Source Crypto Wallets: Why It Matters

In crypto, **transparency is non-negotiable**. Whether you’re storing assets or signing transactions, you need to know your wallet is trustworthy — not just because a company says so, but because the code proves it.

That’s where **open source** comes in.

Wallets that release their code for public inspection offer a higher level of trust, security, and innovation. Begin Wallet embraces this philosophy by making its **core crypto engine fully open source**, allowing anyone to verify how transactions are created, signed, and broadcast.

### 🔍 What Does Open Source Mean in Wallets?

An **open source** wallet (or component) makes its source code **publicly available**, typically on platforms like GitHub. This allows:
- Developers and security experts to **audit the code**.
- The community to suggest **improvements and features**.
- Users to **verify the wallet does exactly what it claims**.

Not all wallets are fully open source — some, like Begin Wallet, take a **modular approach**.

### 🛡️ Begin Wallet’s Open Source Crypto Core

**Begin Wallet’s core cryptographic engine** — the part responsible for key generation, transaction signing, and multi-chain support — is fully open source.

It includes:
- **Cardano and Bitcoin key derivation**
- **Transaction building and signing**
- **Metadata formatting and on-chain proof modules**

You can inspect it all at [github.com/BeginWallet/begin-core](https://github.com/BeginWallet/begin-core). This ensures the most security-critical parts of Begin Wallet are verifiable and trustworthy.

Other wallet layers (such as the UI and APIs) are not yet open source — a common tradeoff for modern multi-platform apps.

### 🧠 Why Partial Open Source Still Matters

Even if a wallet isn’t entirely open source, making **core components public** is a huge step forward. It provides:
- **Proof of transparency** for essential operations.
- **Community contributions** and faster audits.
- **Confidence** that your seed phrase and private keys are handled securely.

Begin Wallet balances security, usability, and transparency by opening up what matters most.

### 💡 How to Evaluate a Wallet’s Transparency

Before choosing a crypto wallet, consider:
1. Is the wallet **fully or partially open source**?
2. Are **key security modules** (e.g. signing, seed handling) public?
3. Is the open repo **actively maintained** and auditable?
4. Are there **community reviews or contributors**?

This context helps you choose tools that align with crypto’s ethos of openness and decentralization.

### 🔓 Trust Through Code, Not Promises

The future of crypto relies on **verifiable software**. Open source wallets — even partial ones — provide a path to that future.

With Begin Wallet, you get a secure, multi-chain experience backed by a transparent, community-reviewed core engine.
