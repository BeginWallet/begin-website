## Why Self-Custody Matters: Your Keys, Your Crypto

When you hear the phrase “Not your keys, not your crypto,” it’s more than just a meme — it’s a core principle of cryptocurrency. Self-custody gives you true ownership of your assets by ensuring that **you** — and only you — hold the private keys to your wallet.

In contrast, custodial solutions like centralized exchanges or third-party services hold your keys, and with them, ultimate control of your funds.

### What Is Self-Custody?

Self-custody means you’re responsible for managing your own crypto wallet and private keys. When you use a non-custodial wallet like Begin Wallet, you generate a **seed phrase** — a human-readable backup that can recover your funds across devices.

With self-custody, there’s no middleman. You don’t need to trust a company, and no one can freeze, access, or mismanage your funds without your consent.

### Why It’s Important

#### 1. **Sovereignty Over Your Assets**
Self-custody ensures you are in full control of your cryptocurrency. It protects against centralized failures, regulatory freezes, or platform shutdowns.

#### 2. **Protection Against Exchange Collapses**
Events like the collapse of FTX and others have shown the dangers of leaving crypto on centralized platforms. Billions in user funds were lost — because users didn’t control their keys.

#### 3. **Censorship Resistance**
When you control your wallet, no one can block transactions or restrict access to your funds. This is vital in countries with capital controls, or for individuals who value financial privacy.

#### 4. **Supports the Decentralized Ethos**
Cryptocurrency was built to remove gatekeepers. Self-custody upholds this vision by ensuring individuals, not corporations, are in charge.
