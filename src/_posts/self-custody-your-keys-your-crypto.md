## Why Self-Custody Matters: Your Keys, Your Crypto

The promise of cryptocurrency is clear: **true financial freedom**. But that freedom only exists if **you control your own keys**. That’s the core principle of self-custody — and it’s more important than ever in 2025.

With rising hacks, bankrupt exchanges, and regulatory uncertainty, trusting centralized platforms is risky. If you don’t own your keys, you don’t truly own your crypto.

### 🔑 What Is Self-Custody?

**Self-custody** means storing your digital assets in a **wallet you control**, where the private keys never leave your device. You — and only you — have access to your funds.

Examples of self-custodial wallets include:
- Begin Wallet
- Ledger (hardware wallet)
- Trezor
- Eternl or Typhon for Cardano

These wallets ensure **you stay in charge**, rather than a third party.

### 🏦 The Risk of Custodial Wallets

A **custodial wallet** is when a third party (like an exchange or fintech app) holds your crypto on your behalf.

If the company gets hacked, shuts down, or freezes withdrawals:
- You might **lose access to your funds**
- You often **can’t withdraw without permission**
- You rely on **their security**, not your own

Cases like FTX, Celsius, and Voyager showed how devastating this can be.

### 🧠 Not Your Keys, Not Your Coins

This phrase has become a mantra in crypto — and for good reason.

When you self-custody, you:
- Own and control your funds 24/7
- Don’t need permission to move your assets
- Can’t be censored, frozen, or de-banked
- Align with the true decentralized ethos of crypto

4. Regularly **test recovery** to make sure your backup works.
