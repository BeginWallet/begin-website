If you’re holding ADA, staking is one of the best ways to earn passive income while supporting the Cardano network. In this guide, we’ll walk you through everything you need to know to stake ADA in 2025 using **Begin Wallet**.

## 🧠 What Is ADA Staking?

Staking ADA means delegating your coins to a stake pool that helps validate transactions on the Cardano blockchain. In return, you earn rewards — typically between 3% and 5% APY — depending on the pool's performance.

Cardano uses a proof-of-stake protocol called **Ouroboros**, which is energy-efficient and secure.
