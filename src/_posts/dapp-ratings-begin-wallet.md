## How dApp Ratings Work in Begin Wallet

The Cardano ecosystem is growing fast, and users are constantly discovering new decentralized apps (dApps). But with so many options, how do you know which dApps are trusted, secure, and offer a great experience?

That’s where **dApp Ratings in Begin Wallet** come in. It’s a powerful, transparent way for users to share feedback — and for developers to improve based on real user data.

---

### Why Rate dApps?

Ratings are essential in any digital ecosystem. Just like you rely on reviews in app stores or marketplaces, **dApp ratings help build trust** and promote quality across the Cardano ecosystem.

Whether you're exploring DeFi, NFTs, or utility tools, seeing how others rate a dApp helps guide better decisions.

### How Begin Wallet’s dApp Rating System Works

Our rating system is built with **transparency and decentralization** at its core. Here's how it functions:

#### 1. ⭐ One Rating per User per dApp  
Each user can rate a dApp once — but they can **update their rating** at any time. This prevents spam and reflects current user sentiment.

#### 2. 📬 Stored On-Chain for Proof  
Ratings are included in your Cardano transaction metadata under **Label 1668**, using a standardized format proposed in [CIP-10](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/1012). This allows any wallet or explorer to verify and use the data.

#### 3. 🧠 Off-Chain Indexing for UX  
While ratings are stored on-chain, we also maintain an off-chain index to calculate **average ratings** and provide smooth in-app browsing.

#### 4. 🧾 Public & Verifiable  
Since the data is on-chain, anyone can audit the rating history of any dApp using a blockchain explorer like [cexplorer.io](https://cexplorer.io).
