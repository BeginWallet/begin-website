# Tokens & Collectibles

The **Tokens & Collectibles** tab is where all your digital assets live â€” from ADA and BTC to NFTs and custom tokens.

---

## ðŸ’¼ What Youâ€™ll See

- **Your native tokens** like ADA and BTC  
- **Custom tokens** from Cardano (e.g., stablecoins, meme coins)  
- **NFTs and collectibles**, displayed with image previews  
- Token balances and market value (where available)  
- Asset grouping by network (Cardano or Bitcoin)

---

## ðŸ‘£ How to Use It

1. **Tap on "Tokens" tab**  
   You'll see a list of all the assets in your wallet, sorted by value.

2. **Tap on a Token or Collectible**  
   View:
   - Full metadata (name, ticker, policy ID)
   - Market price (if available)
   <!-- - Transaction history related to the asset -->

<!-- 3. **Organize by Category**  
   Filter your view by:
   - All assets  
   - Fungible tokens  
   - NFTs and collectibles  
   - Network (Cardano / Bitcoin) -->

3. **Send or Receive from here**  
   Each token screen has quick shortcuts to **Send**, **Receive**.

## ðŸ§  Jamieâ€™s Tips

> You can hide tokens with a zero balance from your view â€” just toggle it on  "Manage Assets" and Lower than 1 is automatically hidden.

> NFTs are displayed with previews and are fully interactive â€” tap to see full artwork and metadata.
