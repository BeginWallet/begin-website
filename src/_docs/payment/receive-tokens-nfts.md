## ðŸ§  Jamieâ€™s Tips

> For extra safety, always double-check you're using the correct address for the right network. Sending assets to the wrong network could result in permanent loss.

> Need to receive a collectible like an NFT? Just use your **Cardano** address â€” Begin Wallet will automatically detect and display it in your Collectibles tab.
