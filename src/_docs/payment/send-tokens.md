## 📝 Jamie’s Notes

> On Cardano, you can batch multiple assets (like $ADA, stablecoins, and NFTs) into one single transaction — saving fees and keeping your on-chain footprint minimal.

> On Bitcoin, you'll be able to adjust the fee rate before confirming to suit your needs (coming soon: smart fee estimator!).
