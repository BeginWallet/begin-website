# Claim your Begin ID

Your **Begin ID** is more than just a username — it’s your identity across the Cardano and Bitcoin ecosystems. Begin ID allows you to send and receive crypto using a **human-readable name** (like `@jamie`) instead of a long address, and it even works outside Begin Wallet in dApps that support the standard.

Begin is also compatible with the **ENS** (Ethereum Name Service) format, increasing interoperability and usability in web3 apps.

And the best part? You get a **public web profile** like:

[https://your-username.bgin.id](https://begin.bgin.id)


This page showcases your wallet address, collectibles, and serves as your identity across dApps and networks.
