# Restore your Begin ID

When you import your wallet into a new device, your **Begin ID** is automatically recognized based on your wallet address. Reclaiming your identity is simple and secure.

---

## ğŸ”„ What Happens When You Restore?

As soon as your wallet is imported, the Begin app checks for any **registered Begin ID** linked to that address. If found, a banner appears on your home screen to guide you through the final steps.

---

## ğŸ‘£ Steps to Restore Your Begin ID

1. **Tap the Banner**  
   A message will appear on the home screen saying your Begin ID is available. Tap the banner to start the process.

2. **Tap Continue**  
   Review the linked Begin ID details and confirm you'd like to restore it.

3. **Sign to Confirm**  
   Youâ€™ll be prompted to sign a message or transaction to prove wallet ownership and complete the restoration.

## âœ… Thatâ€™s it!

Your Begin ID is now fully restored and active on your new device â€” including your:

- Username (e.g., `@jamie`)
- Avatar
- Public profile: `https://jamie.bgin.id`

You can now continue using it across Begin Wallet and compatible dApps.
