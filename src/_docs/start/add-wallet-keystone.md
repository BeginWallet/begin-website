# Connect your Keystone hardware wallet

Using a Keystone device? You’re about to experience the smoothest air-gapped wallet connection out there. Jamie will guide you through the quick and secure QR-based setup.

> 📷 **Note**: Keystone works by scanning and generating QR codes — no cables, Bluetooth, or USB required.

1. **Tap “Connect to Keystone”**
