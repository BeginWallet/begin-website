# Restore your wallet with your seed phrase

Need to access your Begin Wallet on a new device or after reinstalling the app? No problem — Jamie’s here to guide you through restoring your wallet using your seed phrase.

> 🔐 **Reminder**: Your seed phrase is the only way to recover your wallet. Always keep it stored securely and never share it with anyone.

## 🔁 Step-by-step: Add wallet via Seed Phrase

1. **Tap “Restore Wallet”**  
   On the welcome screen, choose **Restore Wallet** to begin the recovery process.

2. **Enter a name for your wallet**  
   Pick a name so you can easily recognize your wallet in the app.

3. **Create a new password**  
   Enter a strong password with **at least 10 characters**. This protects your wallet on this device.

4. **Confirm your password**  
   Type the same password again to confirm it.

5. **Tap Continue**

6. **Enter your seed phrase**  
   You can either:
   - **Paste** it from your clipboard, or  
   - **Enter it manually** word by word in the correct order.  

   ✅ Begin supports:
   - **12-word** seed phrases  
   - **15-word** seed phrases (Begin standard)  
   - **24-word** seed phrases

7. **Tap Continue**

8. **That’s it — congrats! 🎉**  
   Your wallet has been successfully restored.

9. **Tap “Read to Begin”**  
   You’re now ready to start exploring your wallet again.

10. **Already have a Begin ID?**  
    If your Begin ID was linked to your wallet, you’ll see a banner on the home screen to guide you through restoring it.

## ✅ Jamie’s Notes

- Make sure your seed phrase is typed **in the exact original order** with no typos.
- If your Begin ID doesn’t show up automatically, follow the prompt from the home screen to restore it.
- You can restore the same wallet across multiple devices — each will require its own local password.
