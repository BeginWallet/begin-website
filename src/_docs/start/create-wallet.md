# Welcome to Begin! Let’s create your first wallet

Getting started with crypto is easier than ever. In this quick guide, Jamie (your friendly crypto guide 👋) will walk you through creating your first wallet in Begin — from choosing a username to backing up your seed phrase securely.

> 🛡️ **Why it matters**: Your wallet is your key to the decentralized world. Once created, you'll be able to send, receive, and manage assets like ADA, Bitcoin, NFTs, and more.

## 🚀 Step-by-step: Create your first wallet

1. **Tap “Create Wallet”**  
   Launch the Begin Wallet app and tap the **Create Wallet** button on the welcome screen.

2. **Create your Begin ID (optional)**  
   This is your social identity within Begin. You can personalize it — or skip it if you prefer to stay anonymous.

3. **Add an avatar**  
   Pick an image to represent you. This is just for fun and personal flair!

4. **Enter your username**  
   Choose a unique name like `@jamie123`. It must be at least 4 characters long.

5. **Tap Continue**  
   Move on when your ID details are set.

6. **Create a password**  
   Enter a secure password with **at least 10 characters**. This protects access to your wallet on your device.

7. **Confirm your password**  
   Re-enter the same password to confirm. Accuracy matters!

8. **Tap Continue**  
   You're almost there.

9. **Tap “Manual Backup”**  
   This is where you’ll see your **15-word seed phrase** — the key to your wallet. Write it down and store it safely offline.  
   🔐 *Jamie’s Tip*: Never screenshot or share your seed phrase. Anyone with it can access your funds.

10. **Can’t back it up now?**  
    If you tap **“I’ll do it later”**, no problem — but a warning message will appear on the home screen until you complete your backup.

11. **Tap “OK, I wrote it down”**  
    Once you’ve written and confirmed your seed phrase, tap this to continue.

12. **That’s it — congrats! 🎉**  
    You’ve successfully created your wallet.

13. **Tap “Read to Begin”**  
    You're ready to explore, swap, invest, and experience crypto the Begin way!

## ✅ Jamie’s Notes

- You only need one Begin Wallet — you can manage **multiple assets** and even **multiple chains** from it.
- If you skip your backup, make sure to complete it ASAP from the home screen banner.
- Your Begin ID can be updated later from settings if you change your mind.
