# Connect your Ledger hardware wallet

Prefer to use a hardware wallet for ultimate security? You’re in good hands. Jamie will walk you through connecting your Ledger device to Begin — whether you’re using Bluetooth or a USB connection (in browser mode).

> 🔐 **Why Ledger?** Hardware wallets offer unmatched security by keeping your private keys offline.

## ✅ Jamie’s Notes

- You can **add multiple wallets** using different Ledgers, or even multiple accounts on the same device.
- If you already have a Ledger wallet connected, Begin will automatically create a **new wallet instance** when connecting a second one.
- The Ledger device must have the **Cardano app installed and open** before pairing.
- Bluetooth support is available on mobile and Ledger Nano X / Stax / Flex models only.
