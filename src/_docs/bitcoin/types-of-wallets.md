# Types of Bitcoin Wallets

When managing Bitcoin, choosing the right wallet is essential for security and convenience. There are several types of wallets, each offering different benefits based on your needs.

Jamie breaks down the key wallet types below.

## üîí Non-Custodial Wallets

A **non-custodial wallet** means **you** control your private keys, not a third-party service. This gives you full control over your funds and provides a higher level of security.

### Benefits
- **Full control**: Only you have access to your keys.
- **Privacy**: No third party has access to your funds or transaction history.

### Drawbacks
- **Responsibility**: You must secure your keys and backup your seed phrase properly.
- **Risk**: If you lose your seed phrase, you lose access to your wallet and funds.

**Example**: Begin Wallet, Ledger, Keystone.

## ü§ñ Custodial Wallets

In a **custodial wallet**, a third party (such as an exchange or service provider) holds and manages your private keys on your behalf. You typically trust the service to secure your funds.

### Benefits
- **Convenience**: Easier to set up and use, no need to manage keys.
- **Backup**: Many custodial wallets offer backup and recovery options in case you lose access.

### Drawbacks
- **Lack of control**: You do not control your keys, and the service could be hacked or go down.
- **Privacy concerns**: The service provider may have access to your data and transaction history.

**Example**: Coinbase, Binance, BlockFi.

## ‚ùÑÔ∏è Cold Wallets (Offline Wallets)

A **cold wallet** is any wallet that is not connected to the internet. These wallets provide extra protection from online hacks and malware. They are often used for long-term storage of Bitcoin.

### Benefits
- **Maximum security**: Completely isolated from the internet, making it virtually impossible to hack.
- **Ideal for long-term storage**: Cold wallets are perfect for those who don‚Äôt need frequent access to their funds.

### Drawbacks
- **Less convenient**: Not suitable for quick transactions or everyday use.
- **Physical security**: You need to ensure the device is physically secured.

**Example**: Hardware wallets (Ledger, Keystone), Paper wallets.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Multi-Signature (Multi-Sig) Wallets

A **multi-signature wallet** requires multiple private keys to sign a transaction before it can be executed. This provides an added layer of security, as it‚Äôs harder for hackers to compromise multiple keys.

### Benefits
- **Enhanced security**: Multiple keys must be compromised for funds to be accessed.
- **Shared control**: Multi-sig wallets are useful for teams or businesses that want multiple people to be involved in signing transactions.

### Drawbacks
- **Complexity**: Setting up and managing multi-sig wallets can be more complicated than traditional wallets.
- **Cooperation**: All involved parties need to work together to approve transactions.

**Example**: Bitcoin multi-sig setup using services like Casa or Unchained Capital.

## ‚úÖ Jamie‚Äôs Notes

- **Non-custodial wallets** provide the best privacy and control, but come with the responsibility of securing your keys.

- **Cold wallets** are perfect for long-term storage, but less convenient for everyday transactions.
- **Multi-signature wallets** add extra security, making them ideal for businesses or those needing shared access control.
