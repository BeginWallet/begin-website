# Receive Bitcoin (BTC)

Ready to receive BTC? Begin Wallet makes it simple and secure to generate a native SegWit (`bc1...`) or Taproot (`3...`) address so others can send Bitcoin directly to you.

Jamie walks you through how to find your BTC address and safely receive funds.

## 📥 Step-by-step: How to receive BTC

1. **Open your Bitcoin wallet in Begin**  
   Tap the BTC icon from your wallet home screen.

2. **Tap “Receive”**  
   You’ll see your personal Bitcoin receiving address.

3. **Choose how to share it**  
   - **Copy address** to your clipboard  
   - **Show QR code** for someone to scan  
   - **Share** via secure message or email

4. **Wait for confirmations**  
   - Once someone sends BTC, it will appear as “pending” until confirmed on the Bitcoin blockchain.
   - Typically, 1–6 confirmations are standard depending on network rules.

5. **That’s it!**  
   You’ll get notified once the BTC is confirmed and added to your balance.

## ✅ Jamie’s Notes

- Begin generates **native SegWit (bech32)** addresses that start with `bc1`. These are the most efficient and secure format.
- You can generate a new receive address any time — all are linked to your wallet.
- Unlike Cardano, Bitcoin uses **UTXOs** — each incoming payment is a separate output you control.
- No memo or tag needed when receiving BTC.
