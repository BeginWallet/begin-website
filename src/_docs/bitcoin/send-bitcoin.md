# Send Bitcoin (BTC)

Sending Bitcoin from your Begin Wallet is fast, secure, and UTXO-optimized. You’ll use a native SegWit address (starts with `bc1`) and always get a preview of your network fee before confirming the transaction.

Let Jamie show you how it's done.

## 🚀 Step-by-step: How to send BTC

1. **Tap “Send” on your Bitcoin wallet**  
   Make sure you’re in the BTC wallet view, then tap the **Send** button.

2. **Paste or scan the recipient’s address**  
   - Use a QR code or paste it from your clipboard.
   - Begin supports **bech32** (native SegWit) addresses only.

3. **Enter the amount of BTC**  
   - You can also toggle to see the equivalent in your local currency.

4. **Review and set the network fee**  
   - Fees vary by network activity — Begin automatically estimates optimal fee levels (low / standard / high).
   - You can override this if desired.

5. **Confirm the transaction**  
   - You’ll see a preview including recipient, amount, fee, and total.
   - Use biometrics or passcode to confirm.

6. **Done!**  
   - Your transaction is signed and broadcasted.
   - You can tap it in your activity view to follow its progress.

## ✅ Jamie’s Notes

- Begin uses **native SegWit (bech32)** for faster and cheaper transactions.
- Bitcoin uses a **UTXO model**, so you may see “change” outputs — this is normal.
- If your wallet is secured with a Ledger or Keystone device, you'll be prompted to sign the transaction there.
