# Bitcoin

Bitcoin is the original cryptocurrency — a secure, decentralized digital currency that runs without banks or governments. In Begin Wallet, you can manage your Bitcoin alongside Cardano and other assets, all under one secure seed phrase.

In this guide, Jamie helps you understand how Bitcoin works and how to get started.

## ⚙️ How does Bitcoin work?

Bitcoin is a decentralized peer-to-peer network powered by a public blockchain. Here’s how it works:

- **No middlemen**: You can send Bitcoin to anyone, anywhere in the world, without a bank.
- **Proof-of-Work**: Miners verify transactions and secure the network by solving cryptographic puzzles.
- **Fixed supply**: Only 21 million Bitcoin will ever exist, making it a scarce and deflationary asset.
- **Secure and transparent**: Every transaction is recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain — a public ledger anyone can verify.

With Begin Wallet, your Bitcoin is stored securely under your master seed phrase. That means no custodians, no limits, and full control over your keys.

## 🚀 Getting started with Bitcoin in Begin

It’s easy to start using Bitcoin in Begin Wallet:

1. **Create or restore a wallet**  
   Begin supports a 15-word standard seed, and also allows 12-word and 24-word recovery phrases.

2. **Your Bitcoin wallet is auto-created**  
   No extra setup needed — Bitcoin is available by default when you create your Begin wallet.

3. **Send and receive BTC**  
   - Use native SegWit (bech32) addresses for fast, cheap, and secure transactions.
   - Tap “Receive” to get your BTC address or “Send” to transfer funds.

4. **Track your Bitcoin activity**  
   Easily view your BTC transactions and UTXO details directly in your wallet.

5. **Secure your wallet**  
   - Backup your 15-word seed safely.
   - Enable biometrics and passcode protection.
   - Export your wallet if needed for recovery.

## ✅ Jamie’s Notes

- Begin supports full Bitcoin functionality: send, receive, view UTXOs, and sign transactions.
- Your Bitcoin and Cardano wallets share the same seed — but operate independently on their respective blockchains.
- Bitcoin addresses in Begin use the **native SegWit** standard for better efficiency and compatibility.
