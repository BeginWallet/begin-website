# Network Change (In Developement)

Begin Wallet allows you to switch between **Mainnet** and **Preprod** networks. This feature is particularly useful for developers and users who want to test their transactions or try out new features before they go live.

---

## ðŸš€ What You Can Do

- **Mainnet**: Use the live Cardano network for all your transactions.
- **Preprod**: Switch to the Preprod network for testing and experimentation with test tokens.

---

## ðŸ‘£ How to Use It

1. **Tap "Settings"** to open the settings menu.

2. **Select "Network"**  
   - Choose between **Mainnet** or **Preprod** to switch networks.

## ðŸ§  Jamieâ€™s Tips

> The Preprod network is great for testing transactions or new features without risking real assets.

> Be mindful that transactions made on Preprod are not real and do not carry value.
