## 🔐 Step-by-step: Customize your security

1. **Select “Security Settings”**  
   Go to the Settings menu and tap on **Security Settings**.

2. **Tap “Passcode” to manage it**  
   Set, update, or remove your local app passcode.

3. **Tap “Biometrics” to enable it**  
   Use Face ID, Touch ID, or your fingerprint to:
   - Unlock your wallet  
   - Confirm transactions  
   > (Mobile only)

## ✅ Jamie’s Notes

- Biometrics make daily use more secure and seamless — no typing needed.
- Your passcode is required for backup recovery and sensitive actions.
- These settings are local to your device and never shared or stored on a server.
