# Manage App Notifications

Stay in the loop or keep things quiet — the choice is yours. Begin lets you control whether or not you receive real-time push notifications.

Jamie shows you how to toggle it on in a flash.

---

## 🔔 Step-by-step: Enable notifications

1. **Select “Notifications”**  
   Inside the Settings menu, tap the **Notifications** option.

2. **Tap the switch to enable**  
   This will activate push notifications for the entire app.

## ✅ Jamie’s Notes

- Right now, this setting controls **all notifications** at once.
- You’ll get alerts for important events like:
  - Incoming/outgoing transactions
  - Price Alerts
  - dApp activity
  - Governance participation and updates

> 🧩 **Coming soon**: We’re working on adding more granular controls, so you’ll be able to fine-tune which alerts you receive (or don’t).
