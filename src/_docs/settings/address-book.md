# Manage your Address Book

Your Address Book is the perfect way to save frequently used wallets, friends' Begin IDs, or ADA Handles — so you can send crypto faster and avoid manual errors.

Jamie will show you how to add a new contact in seconds.

## 📒 Step-by-step: Add a new contact

1. **Select “Address Book”**  
   Head into Settings and tap **Address Book** from the menu.

2. **Tap “Add Contact”**

3. **Type the name**  
   Give your contact a name (e.g., “Alice” or “My Exchange Wallet”).

4. **Type their Begin ID or ADA Handle**  
   Enter the unique Begin ID (e.g. `@satoshi`) or ADA Handle (e.g. `$jane`) for the contact.

5. **Tap the suggested match**  
   If a matching ID is found, it will automatically fill in the wallet address.

6. **Or enter the address manually**  
   You can skip the ID lookup and just paste or type the address directly.

## 🗑️ How to remove a contact

Want to clean up your list?

1. **Tap the Trash icon** next to the contact you want to delete

That’s it — the contact is gone!

## ✅ Jamie’s Notes

- All saved contacts are synced locally — they’re private and stored securely on your device.
- You can edit or delete any contact anytime from the Address Book screen.
- Begin IDs and ADA Handles make it easier to send without copying long wallet addresses.
