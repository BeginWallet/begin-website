# Change Your Display Currency

Want to view your crypto balances in USD, EUR, JPY, or something else? Begin makes it easy to switch the default fiat currency used across your wallet.

Jamie shows you how to make the switch in seconds.

## 💱 Step-by-step: Change your currency

1. **Select “Language & Currency”**  
   Open the Settings menu and tap on **Language & Currency**.

2. **Tap on the currency dropdown**  
   This will show a list of available fiat currencies.

3. **Select your preferred currency**  
   Once selected, all balances, token values, and yield displays will update instantly.

## ✅ Jamie’s Notes

- This setting only affects how prices are displayed — it doesn’t convert or swap your crypto.
- Your selected currency will be remembered across sessions and devices (if logged into your Begin ID).
- Exchange rates are updated in real-time from trusted price oracles.
