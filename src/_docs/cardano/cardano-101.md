# Cardano

Cardano is a decentralized platform that provides a secure and scalable infrastructure for the development of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. With its unique proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, Cardano promises greater security, sustainability, and scalability than traditional blockchain networks like Bitcoin.

Jamie is here to walk you through the fundamentals of Cardano.

## 🚀 Key Features of Cardano

### 1. **Proof of Stake (PoS) Consensus**
Cardano uses a **Proof of Stake (PoS)** mechanism, where instead of mining (like Bitcoin), validators are chosen based on the amount of ADA (Cardano's native cryptocurrency) they hold and are willing to "stake" as collateral.

### 2. **Ouroboros Protocol**
Cardano’s **Ouroboros** is a secure and scalable PoS protocol that ensures the network’s integrity and decentralization. It is energy-efficient and makes Cardano environmentally friendly compared to Proof of Work (PoW) blockchains like Bitcoin.

### 3. **Layered Architecture**
Cardano features a **two-layered architecture**:  
- **Settlement Layer (SL)**: Handles the basic transfer of ADA and provides security.
- **Computational Layer (CL)**: Manages smart contracts, dApps, and other features.

### 4. **Decentralization & Governance**
Cardano empowers its community with on-chain governance, allowing ADA holders to vote on proposals that shape the future of the network.

## 🔍 How Cardano Compares to Bitcoin

While both Bitcoin and Cardano are blockchain platforms, there are some key differences:

- **Consensus Mechanism**: Bitcoin uses **Proof of Work (PoW)**, while Cardano uses **Proof of Stake (PoS)**, offering higher scalability and lower energy consumption.
- **Smart Contracts**: Cardano supports **smart contracts**, enabling the creation of dApps and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, which Bitcoin does not support natively.
- **Speed & Scalability**: Cardano’s design allows it to handle more transactions per second than Bitcoin, making it more suitable for enterprise-level applications.
- **Environmental Impact**: Cardano’s PoS mechanism is far more energy-efficient than Bitcoin’s PoW.

## ✅ Jamie’s Notes

- Cardano’s focus on **security** and **sustainability** positions it as a leading blockchain for the future of decentralized finance.
- **ADA**, the native cryptocurrency of Cardano, is essential for staking, voting, and interacting with dApps and smart contracts.
