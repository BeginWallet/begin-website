   - Copy the **Cardano address** to your clipboard to share it with the sender, or simply **share the QR code** if they’re using a compatible wallet or scanner.

5. **Wait for Transaction Confirmation**
   - Once the sender has initiated the transaction, you’ll receive ADA directly into your wallet.
   - The transaction will be confirmed on the Cardano network shortly after.

6. **Check Your Balance**

   - You’ll see the ADA reflected in your available balance.

## 🔒 Jamie’s Tips for Secure Receiving

- **Verify the address**: Double-check the address you’re sharing to avoid mistakes. A small typo can cause the funds to be lost.
- **Use QR codes**: If possible, use QR codes to share your address. This eliminates the chance of copying an incorrect address.
- **Stay patient**: Cardano transactions are typically fast, but network congestion can occasionally cause delays. Just give it a moment!

## ✅ Jamie’s Notes

- **Cardano Address Format**: ADA wallets typically use **Bech32** addresses for enhanced security and efficiency.
- **Transaction Fees**: While receiving ADA is free, you should be aware of small fees when sending ADA (e.g., network or wallet fees).
- **Multiple Addresses**: Begin Wallet supports generating multiple receiving addresses for better privacy and organization.
